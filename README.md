- Hello, I'm a student currently learning the very basics of coding. Looking to become proficient in back-end programming, though I might branch out to become a fullstack dev in the near future.
- I tend to spend most of my free time playing video games and lifting weights. My favorite genre is any kind of metal.
- Due to my relative lack of experience as of now, I'm mostly focused on my studies before any big projects.
- You can reach me at nihilzero28@gmail.com (It's an old username from my oh so "cool and badass" teenage years, ignore its juvenile nature :p)
